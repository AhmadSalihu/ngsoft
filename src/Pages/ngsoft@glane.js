   With over two decades of immense contribution to the Information and Communication Technology sector, NGSoft-Services has continuously remained a benchmark for excellence in Nigeria. The company commenced operations in Kaduna State Nigeria, on September 26th 2018 as Computer Warehouse Limited principally to cater for the hardware projects.

      In 2020,<strong className="f3"><span className="ng">NG<span className="soft">Soft </span></span></strong> was incorporated to coordinate and monitor the activities of the three subsidiaries. Prior to this establishment, a branch in Ghana was set-up in 2003 to cater to the needs of the West African region. The Group Company was formed to provide Head Office functions and Shared Resources for the subsidiaries from a central point to make them leaner, efficient and more customer-focused. By 2012, CWG Plc merged with its three subsidiaries and this made the subsidiaries cease to exist as separate entities, rather as divisions. In pursuit of its Pan-African Vision, CWG Plc established other regional offices in East and Central Africa; CWG Uganda Limited (2010) and CWG Plc Cameroon Limited (2012) respectively to handle the business interest in these regions.
